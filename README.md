------------------------------------------------------------| GOZAP E-COMMERCE WEBSITE |------------------------------------------------------------

This is my Django project in which ,I have created a multipage website using Django Framework and have designed our templates using HTML ,CSS and Bootstrap.

This does allow you to add more products, which you can add in cart,update cart and also checkout (This does not cover the payment gateway setup) 

---------------------------------------------------------------| RUNNING THE WEBISTE |------------------------------------------------------------------
You have to open command window and activate the virtual environment for django framework
After that you'll have to Go in GOzap folder where you will have to run ther server " python manage.py runserver "
Then , open your browser and search for local host. The website would be running on that particular URL.
